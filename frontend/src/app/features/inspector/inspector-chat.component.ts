/**
 * A chat, so the Inspector has something to inspect.
 * https://docs.copilotkit.ai/angular/mastra/inspector
 *
 * Nothing here mounts the Inspector, and that is the page's whole point:
 * `@copilotkit/angular` mounts it for you \u2014 the `CopilotKit` service creates
 * `cpk-web-inspector`, supplies the application's core, and appends it to
 * `document.body` after the first browser render.
 *
 * The page is emphatic that a hand-written mount must be deleted rather than
 * left alongside it: the framework reuses an existing `cpk-web-inspector`, but
 * a hand-rolled component's `DestroyRef.onDestroy` removes that element
 * unconditionally, so a route change tears out the Inspector the framework is
 * driving and it does not return without a full reload. This repo has never had
 * one, so there was nothing to retract.
