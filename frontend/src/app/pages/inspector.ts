          Open the demo, send <em>Can you tell me a joke?</em>, then click the
          Inspector launcher in the top-right corner and walk the quickstart's
          confirm-setup step: open <strong>Agents</strong>, pick
          <code>default</code> in the sidebar agent selector, then open
          <strong>AG-UI Events</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
          <strong>Pass:</strong> the strip at the top of the demo reads
          <code>cpk-web-inspector mounted</code> with one element on
          <code>document.body</code>, the launcher is there without this repo
          mounting anything, the Agent panel shows <code>default</code> once
          selected, and <strong>AG-UI Events</strong> has the run's events in
          it. <strong>Fail:</strong> no launcher, or the strip stays on
          <code>no cpk-web-inspector</code> — check you are on
          <code>ng serve</code> and not a production build, which is the one
          case where it never appears.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
          Note the extra step. The quickstart says
          <em>"Open Agents, then Agent. Your agent is listed"</em>, but the
          panel opens on <code>No agent selected</code> — the agent appears
          only after picking it from the sidebar selector, which the step does
          not mention. The recorder performs both halves and logs each state.

          <code>&#64;copilotkit/angular</code> depends on
          <code>&#64;copilotkit/web-inspector</code> directly, so there is no
          package to add and no version to pin. The <code>CopilotKit</code>
          service creates <code>cpk-web-inspector</code>, hands it the
          application's core, and appends it to <code>document.body</code> after
          the first browser render.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
          That is why this route's demo is just a chat: it exists to give the
          Inspector something to inspect. Confirmed on this harness \u2014 the
          element is present on <code>/inspector/demo</code> with no code here
          creating it.

          This repo does not set <code>enableInspector</code>, so it takes the
          default. The shipped gate is
          <code
            >isBrowser &amp;&amp; isDevelopment &amp;&amp; enableInspector !==
            false</code
          >: opting out is explicit, but opting <em>in</em> on a production
          build is not possible \u2014 an explicit <code>true</code> never
          overrides a production or server environment.

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
          The guide says "nothing to do for either", and the reasons are
          checkable. The <code>&#64;copilotkit/web-inspector</code> import is a
          dynamic <code>import()</code> inside the service, so the bundler
          splits it into its own chunk that a production build never requests.
          Mounting runs in <code>afterNextRender</code> behind an
          <code>isPlatformBrowser</code> check, so the element is never created
          during a server render \u2014 which matters because the web component
          registers itself against <code>customElements</code>, and that does
          not exist on the server. This repo ships SSR, so both paths are live
          here.

      <ui-panel heading="Positioning the launcher">
        <p class="mb-3 text-sm text-slate-700">
          The launcher defaults to the top-right and positions itself with an
          inline transform, so an override has to neutralise that transform
          before choosing a corner:
        </p>
        <ui-doc-sample
          caption="src/styles.css \u2014 from the guide, not applied here"
          language="css"

        />
        <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-700">
          Left unapplied on purpose. The default corner is what the Quickstart
          step tells a reader to look for, so moving it here would make this
          harness disagree with the page it is testing.

      <ui-callout title="No hand-written mount to retract">
        The guide warns that a <code>WebInspector</code> component from before
        <strong>0.4.0</strong> must be deleted, not merely left alone: the
        framework reuses an existing <code>cpk-web-inspector</code>, but the
        hand-written component's <code>DestroyRef.onDestroy</code> removes that
        element unconditionally, so a route change tears out the Inspector the
        framework is now driving and it does not come back without a full
        reload. This repo never mounted one by hand, so the upgrade to 0.4.0
        carried no retraction \u2014 the warning is verified as not applicable
        rather than skipped.

          A chat and nothing else — the emptiness is the evidence. It mounts
          no Inspector, and the launcher is there anyway.

        <p class="mb-3 text-sm text-slate-700">
          The demo route carries a probe strip above the chat. It is not
          something the guide asks for: it counts
          <code>cpk-web-inspector</code> elements in the document and names
          which of the guide's three cases it found — exactly one
          (<strong>mounted</strong>, the documented result), none
          (<strong>absent</strong>, nothing on the route has injected the
          <code>CopilotKit</code> service yet), or more than one
          (<strong>duplicate</strong>, the state a leftover hand-written mount
          produces). Without it the only evidence in a recording is a launcher
          in one corner of the frame, which is not something a viewer can read.
