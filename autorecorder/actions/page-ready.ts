/**
 * "Is this page actually ready to be driven?"
 *
 * The engine waits for the demo route to return HTML and for `chatReady` to be
 * visible, and then hands over. On a warm route that is enough. On a cold one it
 * is not: a dev server compiles client chunks lazily, so the markup can be on
 * screen while the framework has not yet attached a single event listener. The
 * recorder then types into an input that is not wired to anything — the
 * characters land in the DOM, the submit does nothing, and the run either fails
 * with "agent never responded" or records a video of a chat that never sent.
 *
 * That is what happened to the slots page: three tabs, each remounting a chat,
 * with a prompt fired at a route the dev server was still compiling.
 *
 * ── Why not the existing waitForHydration() ────────────────────────────────
 * `core/overlays/taskbar.ts` has one, and it is neat: it appends a probe to
 * <html> and watches for the framework to delete it while reconciling. But it
 * cannot distinguish "not hydrated yet" from "hydrated before we asked" — both
 * look like a probe that never disconnects, so on an already-settled page it
 * burns its full timeout and returns false. The engine says as much in its own
 * comment, which is why step 3 skips it. These checks return the moment the page
 * is settled instead, so they cost nothing when there was nothing to wait for.
 *
 * ── Portability ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Nothing here knows about Mastra, CopilotKit, React or Next. It reads
 * `SELECTORS.chatInput` from the adaptation config and otherwise relies on
 * `document.readyState` and a DOM-stability window, which mean the same thing in
 * an Angular or Vue app as they do here. It lives in `actions/` only because
 * `core/` is frozen: it belongs in `core/` and should be promoted and ported to
 * the other framework repos, which all have this same gap.
