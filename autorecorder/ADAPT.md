# ADAPT.md — porting this recorder to another CopilotKit integration

**Read this file before changing anything. Follow it in order.**

You are adapting a working screen-recording suite from one CopilotKit
integration to another. It currently records **Microsoft Agent Framework
(Python) + React**. The target might be `ms-agent-dotnet`, `agno`, `langgraph`,
an Angular frontend, or anything else CopilotKit documents.

The suite arrives **working**. You are editing a reference implementation, not
filling in blanks. If you find yourself writing a file from scratch, stop and
re-read this.

---

## Definition of done

```bash
npm run doctor          # static: config, files, line ranges, handlers
npm run doctor:online   # also: every demo route, every doc URL, the selectors
npm run record -- --<first-page-id>
```

`doctor` must exit **0**. Then one real recording must report `[PASS]` and the
video must be watchable.

Nothing else counts as finished. Not "the config looks right" — the doctor
exiting zero. If you cannot make it pass, say so and say which check fails;
do not describe the port as complete.

---

## What you may edit

| Path | Edit? | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `config/project.config.ts` | **Yes** | Framework slug, doc root, URLs, start commands |
| `config/pages.config.ts` | **Yes** | One entry per doc page |
| `config/selectors.config.ts` | **Yes** | How to find the chat surface in this frontend |
| `actions/*.action.ts` | **Yes** | What to do on a page that needs more than "send a prompt" |
| `actions/index.ts` | **Yes** | Which handler serves which page id |
| `core/**` | **No** | Engine, IDE simulator, overlays, cursor, doctor |
| `cli.ts` | **No** | Argument parsing and the run summary |

**Do not edit `core/`.** It contains no framework-specific knowledge — every
such value already comes from `config/`. If you believe a change to `core/` is
required, that is a finding to report, not a change to make quietly: it means
something framework-specific leaked into shared code, and every other repo using
this folder has the same problem.

---

## Step 1 — Identity

Edit `config/project.config.ts`. Every field has a comment saying what it is.

The one to get right is `framework`: the slug exactly as it appears in
`https://docs.copilotkit.ai/<framework>/...`. Doc URLs are built from it, so a
wrong slug silently records the wrong framework's documentation.

`videoPrefix` **must** identify both sides of the integration — `MSPY-react`,
`MSNET-react`, `AGNO-angular` — because these files end up in one folder
together, and a prefix naming only the agent makes an Angular recording
indistinguishable from the React one. Change it in the same edit as `framework`,
then **delete `videos/*.webm` left over under the old prefix**: nothing renames
them, so they survive every later run and read as current recordings.

If the backend is not Python, `backendStartCmd` and `backendHealthPath` change.
They are only ever printed or fetched; nothing parses them.

`runtimeWarmPath` is the frontend path the browser posts to in order to reach the
agent — `/api/copilotkit` where the runtime is mounted inside the app, or whatever
this project uses. It is requested once before the first prompt of every
recording, because a dev server builds API routes on first request and that first
request would otherwise be the prompt itself: the endpoint spends its time
compiling instead of answering, and the run reports that the agent never replied.
Set it to `''` for a project where nothing needs warming.

## Step 2 — Fetch the real doc nav

Do not copy the page list from another repo, and do not work from memory. Fetch
`https://docs.copilotkit.ai/<framework>` and read its sidebar.

Frameworks share most pages — quickstart, prebuilt components, slots, headless
UI, generative UI, shared state — but not all. Some lack pages the reference has;
some have pages it does not. A page that 404s is a finding worth reporting, not
something to quietly keep.

## Step 3 — The page registry

Edit `config/pages.config.ts`: delete pages this framework does not document,
add the ones it does, and put them in doc-nav order — order determines the number
in each video filename.

Entries are short because URLs and filenames are derived. Set `docPath` and
`route`; never write a full URL.

`startLine`/`endLine` are what the simulated IDE highlights, and they are the
thing most likely to be wrong after a port. Open each `ideFile` and read the
range. If the frontend marks its interesting lines with `[!code highlight]` or
`#region`, keep those markers — the doctor uses them to detect drift later.

**Quickstart leads with the dependency manifest. This is not optional.** Its
`ideFile` must be the frontend's `package.json` — or whatever names and pins
dependencies in this stack — with the range covering the block that shows the
CopilotKit and AG-UI versions, plus any `overrides`/`resolutions` that pin them.
The quickstart code itself moves to the first `extraTabs` entry.

The reason is that these packages move fast, and a recording is evidence. A video
of a working demo says nothing useful unless the viewer can see which versions it
worked against — and this is the one page every viewer watches first. It is also
the fastest way to explain a bug report six months later. Keep it as tab one in
every adaptation.

## Step 4 — The selector contract

Edit `config/selectors.config.ts`.

If the target frontend is React using CopilotKit's prebuilt components, the
defaults likely work unchanged. **If it is Angular, or the app renders its own
chat, they will not.** Open a demo page, inspect the real chat input, submit
control and assistant message, and write selectors that match those and nothing
else.

`assistantMessage` is the one to be careful with. It drives both "has the reply
started" and "has it finished". If it matches a container rather than individual
messages, every reply looks complete the instant it begins, and the videos show
prompts with no answers.

`npm run doctor:online` reports which selectors match nothing on a live page.

## Step 5 — The actions

Most pages need nothing: with no entry in `ACTION_MAP` they get
`runStandardAction`, which types the prompt, submits, and waits for the reply.

Write a handler only for pages that need more — switching tabs, clicking an
approval button, opening a panel. Copy the closest existing handler and build on
the helpers in `core/actions.ts` rather than re-implementing them:

```ts
const msgCount = await sendPrompt(page, config.prompt);
await waitForAgentResponseCompletion(page, config.waitAfterPromptMs ?? 4000, msgCount);
```

Pass that count through on multi-turn pages, or the previous turn's reply is
mistaken for this one's.

A handler's fourth argument, `ctx`, is how it reports what it saw. Use it
instead of `console.warn`, which reaches nobody:

```ts
export const runHitlAction: PageActionHandler = async (page, config, _rootPath, ctx) => {
  ...
  if (!cardAppeared) ctx.fail('approval card never rendered');   // [FAIL], clip still saved
  if (!approveEnabled) ctx.warn('Approve stayed enabled after the click'); // [PASS*] with the note
};
```

`ctx.timeouts` carries the resolved waits for the page (see `core/timeouts.ts`;
override per project in `project.config.ts` or per page with `timeouts`).

Delete handlers for pages that no longer exist. The doctor warns about orphans.

**Notes written on screen are short and scruffy.** When a page records a finding
rather than a working feature, `openNotepadWindow` + `typeInNotepad` put the
reason on screen — in **three to five lowercase lines, no punctuation, no
headings, no version block**, the way someone types when they want the point
down before they forget it. The text is typed one character at a time on camera,
so a long structured writeup takes a minute to appear and reads as documentation
rather than as a note. Put the detail in the handler's header comment instead.
`actions/shared-state.action.ts` is the reference; see README → *How a Notepad
note is written*.

## Step 6 — Prove it

```bash
npm run doctor:online
npm run record -- --<first-page-id>
```

Then **watch the video**. The doctor cannot tell you the cursor rested somewhere
useless or the IDE highlighted the wrong function. Check: the doc page scrolls
and the taskbar is visible; the IDE shows the code the page is about; the demo
gets a real answer.

Then record the rest.

---

## Things that will bite you

**A page that never answers now fails the run.** That is deliberate — it used to
report `[PASS]`. If a page fails this way, the demo is broken or
`assistantMessage` does not match; both are real findings.

**A cold dev server serves markup before it serves behaviour.** The engine waits
for the demo route to respond and for `chatReady` to be visible, then hands over —
but client chunks are compiled lazily, so the input can be on screen with nothing
wired to it. Typing then goes nowhere: the characters land, the submit does not
fire, and the page fails as "agent never responded" while looking perfectly fine
on video. `actions/page-ready.ts` closes this: `waitForPageReady` (called once for
every page in `executePageAction`) waits for `document.readyState`, a DOM-stability
window, an input that is genuinely enabled, and the warmed endpoint above.
`waitForDomSettled` is the lighter half, for handlers that remount a chat
mid-run — a tab switch has exactly the same problem as first load.

That file is framework-agnostic on purpose and **belongs in `core/`**; it lives in
`actions/` only because `core/` is frozen. Every repo using this suite has the
same gap, so promote and port it.

**Pages that replace the message view.** A page that swaps in a custom message
component renders none of CopilotKit's classes, so detection finds nothing and
reports "agent never responded" on a page that works. Pass a per-page selector
instead of widening the global one:

```ts
await sendPrompt(page, prompt, { messageSelector: '.my-custom-bubble' });
await waitForAgentResponseCompletion(page, wait, msgCount, '.my-custom-bubble');
```

`actions/slots.action.ts` does exactly this for its level-3 tab.

**Controls underneath the taskbar overlay.** The simulated taskbar occupies the
bottom 48px and swallows clicks. A send button sitting there never receives the
click; the submit lands via the Enter fallback instead. Harmless, but do not
spend an afternoon on why a click "did nothing".

**Line ranges drift silently.** Nothing errors when a range points at the wrong
code — the video just shows the wrong thing. Re-run `npm run doctor` after
touching the frontend.

**Not every page can use the shared helper.** One page in the reference
(`headless-ui`) is deliberately left on its own implementation because routing it
through `sendPrompt` broke it. If a page misbehaves only after you "tidied" it,
put it back and leave a comment saying why.

---

## Reporting back

When you finish, state:

- which pages you added, removed, or renumbered, and why
- any doc page that 404s or is missing from the nav for this framework
- which selectors you had to change
- any page whose recording fails, and the doctor output for it
- anything that made you want to edit `core/`

A port that silently drops pages to make the doctor pass is worse than one that
reports three failures honestly.
