# Autorecorder

Automated screen-recording suite for CopilotKit framework integrations. It
produces one narrated-looking demo video per documentation page: read the doc,
switch to VS Code and show the code that implements it, switch to the browser and
drive the live feature.

Currently configured for **Mastra (TypeScript) + Angular** — the 11 routes of
this repo that have a chrome-free `/demo` page. The two remaining doc routes,
the Introduction landing page and the doc-drift report, have nothing to drive;
see *Scope* below.

> **Porting this to another framework?** Read **[ADAPT.md](ADAPT.md)** first. It
> is written for the person or agent doing the port, and it is the contract the
> `doctor` command enforces.

## Run it

Both ports must be up first — the recorder refuses to start otherwise, because
a video of a dead page is worse than no video.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...    # the runtime process needs it; backend/.env is never read
cd frontend && npm run dev      # Copilot Runtime :8200 + ng serve :4200
```

There is no third service to start. The Mastra agent is imported as source by
`frontend/server.ts` and runs **inside** the runtime process, through
`MastraAgent.getLocalAgent` — so the pre-flight "backend" check targets
`http://localhost:8200/api/copilotkit/info`: if the runtime answers, the agent is
loaded.

`npm run dev` starts **two** processes. Angular has no server route to host the
Copilot Runtime, so it runs as its own Node process (`frontend/server.ts`) on
8200 and the browser posts across origins to it — which is why `runtimeWarmPath`
in `project.config.ts` is an absolute URL rather than a path.

Then:

```bash
cd autorecorder
npm install
npx playwright install chromium

npm run doctor            # is the configuration sane?
npm run record -- --list  # what will be recorded
npm run record -- --quickstart
npm run record            # all pages, in order
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--list`, `--help` | Print every registered route and exit |
| `--doctor` | Validate the configuration; exits 1 on error |
| `--doctor --online` | Also probe every doc/demo URL and the selectors |
| `--<page-id>` | Record one page — `--quickstart`, `--a2ui` |
| `--page=<id>` | Same thing, explicit form |
| `--filter=<query>` | Record every page whose id or name contains the query |
| `--force` | Record even if the pre-flight health check fails |

Videos land in `videos/` as `MASTRA-angular-<NN>-<name>.webm`, 1920×1080, ~25fps
(Playwright's capture rate; it is not configurable).

**`videos/` is gitignored on purpose.** Recordings are build output — reproducible
from this folder plus `npm run record` — and committing them is expensive: the clips
at ~5MB each, rewritten on every re-record, took one repo's `.git` to 348MB before its
history had to be rewritten. Publish them as release assets or to a bucket. Keep
this policy when you copy the folder into another repo.

---

## Scope in this repo

A page is recordable only if it has something to drive, and the recorder reaches
every demo at `<route>/demo`. Two of this app's doc routes are reference
material with no such page and are deliberately **not** registered:

| Route | Why it has no video |
|---|---|
| `/` | Orientation and a live connection check; it has no demo route. |
| `/doc-sync` | Re-fetches every tracked doc page and diffs it; a report, not a feature. |
| `/doc-sync` | Re-fetches the tracked doc pages and diffs them; a report, not a feature. |

Registering it anyway would fail `doctor --online`, because `demoUrl` is always
`route + demoSuffix` and there is no per-page way to say "this one has no demo".
That is a gap in `core/`, not something to work around here — see ADAPT.md.

Four routes (`/threads`, `/memory`, `/attachments`, `/headless`) share one
`docPath`, because the Angular docs cover all four topics on one page.

Three pages record a **documented limitation** rather than a working feature, and
say so on screen in a Notepad window rather than leaving the viewer to guess:

| Page | What the video shows |
|---|---|
| `a2ui` | Middleware enabled, renderer inert — the guide's catalog snippets are not self-contained, so no `a2ui.catalog` can be supplied. |
| `voice-multimodal` | The microphone records; this runtime configures no transcription service, so transcription fails by design. The turn is then completed by keyboard. |
| `threads` | Thread endpoints are licensed; unlicensed the list stays empty and the drawer renders locked. The chat beside it answers normally. |

That Notepad overlay lives in `actions/notepad.ts`. Like `actions/page-ready.ts`
it is framework-agnostic and belongs in `core/`; it sits in `actions/` only
because `core/` is frozen.

### How a Notepad note is written

**Three to five lines, lowercase, no punctuation, no structure.** It is being
typed by someone mid-recording who wants the point down before they forget it —
not written up afterwards. No headings, no bullet hierarchy, no version block,
no full sentences with commas and full stops. Skip the apostrophes.

```
panel says high the agent says it cant see anything
both halves are on the wire though i checked
context just sits in requestContext nothing puts it in the prompt
state wants memory on the agent and theres none so it gets dropped
guide doesnt mention either of them
```

The reason is that the note is typed on camera one character at a time. A
thirty-line writeup takes most a minute to appear, buries the screen it is
supposed to annotate, and reads like documentation — at which point the viewer
stops watching the demo and starts reading. Five lines land in a few seconds and
still say what broke and why.

Detail that does not fit belongs in the handler's header comment and on the
route page, where it can be read at leisure. Size the window to the note
(`height: '250px'` for five lines); a short note in a tall window reads as an
unfinished document.

`actions/shared-state.action.ts` is the reference. The a2ui, voice, and threads
notes predate this convention and are still long-form.

## Tracking recordings

Clips are **not** in git, and every run overwrites the same 11 filenames in place
— so nothing about the files themselves says which are fresh. `npm run manifest`
is what closes that gap:

```bash
npm run record            # produces the clips
npm run manifest          # records their state — run this straight after
```

It writes two committed files next to the (uncommitted) videos:

| File | For |
|---|---|
| `videos/manifest.json` | source of truth — per clip: mtime, size, sha256, the source files it shows, and a hash of those files plus the page definition |
| `videos/MANIFEST.md` | the same thing as a table, readable on GitHub |

Commit both. **The diff on those files is the record of what a run changed** —
that is the whole mechanism. Together they are ~12KB, against ~84MB of video.

| Status | Means |
|---|---|
| ✅ current | clip matches the code it shows |
| 🆕 new | the clip changed since the last manifest — this run re-recorded it |
| ⚠️ stale | a source file was modified *after* the clip was recorded |
| ⚠️ drifted | mtimes look fine but the source content hash moved (mtimes all reset on a fresh clone, which hides staleness — this catches it) |
| ❌ missing | a registered page with no clip on disk |

A clip is judged against the files it actually puts on screen — its `ideFile` and
any `extraTabs` — plus its own page definition, so changing a prompt or a
highlighted line range marks it stale exactly as an edit to the code does.

`npm run manifest:check` prints without writing and exits 1 if anything is stale
or missing, which is the form to put in CI.

**What it does not tell you: whether the run passed.** Playwright saves the video
even when a page fails, so a clip from a failed run still looks current. Freshness
and correctness are different questions — the run summary answers the second one.

---

## Reading the summary

```
   ✅ [PASS]  (24.1s) Quickstart -> MASTRA-angular-01-Quickstart.webm
   ⚠️  [PASS*] (31.7s) Memory -> MASTRA-angular-09-Memory.webm
        · Doc page (…/threads-memory-attachments-headless): Timeout 25000ms exceeded
   ❌ [FAIL]  (19.4s) Headless UI -> MASTRA-angular-11-HeadlessUi.webm
        · Demo step failed: Agent never produced a response within 30s
```

- **PASS** — every step completed.
- **PASS\*** — recorded, with a note. Either the external doc page misbehaved
  (intro footage degraded, feature not implicated), or the page's handler
  reported something the doc promises that it did not see (`ctx.warn`), or the
  browser console logged errors during the demo step.
- **FAIL** — the demo route 404'd, never rendered a chat surface, the agent never
  answered, the IDE view could not be built, or the handler reported that the
  feature under test did not work (`ctx.fail`). The clip is still saved as
  evidence. The process exits 1, so this is safe to gate CI on.

Every run also writes `videos/RECORD_RESULTS.json` — one entry per page with
the verdict, duration, warnings and distinct console errors. `ci/lib/report.mjs`
reads it, so the CI report lists what *this run* recorded rather than every
`.webm` that happens to be in the folder.

Every framework-specific value lives in `config/`. If something in `core/` needs
to change for a port, that is a bug in this folder — see ADAPT.md.

## What a recording actually does

1. **Doc page** — opens the real documentation URL, waits for hydration, then
   scrolls at reading pace and rests the cursor on a code block. Clicks VS Code
   on the simulated taskbar.
2. **IDE** — renders the project's own source, read from disk and highlighted
   with Shiki, with the page's line range selected. Multi-tab pages switch tabs.
   Served from the frontend's origin via an intercepted route, so the doc page is
   fully unloaded rather than painted over. Clicks Chrome on the taskbar.
3. **Demo** — opens the chrome-free demo route, waits for it to be genuinely
   ready, types the prompt, waits for the reply to finish streaming, and pauses
   for reading.

### What makes it read as a person

Every pace in a take comes from `core/overlays/human.ts`, seeded from the
page id. So the Quickstart clip and the Chat UI clip do not type, pause and
scroll in the same rhythm — but tonight's Quickstart clip is identical to
last night's, which keeps two recordings of the same page comparable.

- **Typing** has a person's rhythm: jittered keystrokes, a beat after
  punctuation, the odd mid-sentence pause. A retry after a swallowed submit is
  typed quickly instead — that is the recorder recovering, not a performance.
- **Scrolling** is in bursts: a few wheel notches, a reading pause, a few more,
  sometimes a nudge back up.
- **Pauses** vary by about a quarter around their nominal length.
- **The cursor** overshoots slightly on long travel and settles, hovers a
  variable moment before a click, drifts while a reply streams instead of
  freezing, and starts each take somewhere plausible rather than dead centre.
- **The IDE window** fades in over 180ms instead of cutting.

Two details worth knowing, because both were bugs once:

- Overlays are injected as children of `<html>`. The doc site is itself a React
  app and reclaims that element on hydration. `ensureOverlays` installs a MutationObserver that re-attaches them
  if a render pass deletes them, and step 1 waits for hydration before scrolling
  so a remount cannot snap the page back to the top.
- Playwright starts recording when the page is created, so the first navigation
  is dead footage. The doc URL is warmed in a throwaway page first, which cuts
  it roughly in half; removing the rest would need an ffmpeg trim in post.
- A dev server serves markup before it serves behaviour. "The route responded"
  and "the chat works" are different claims: client chunks compile lazily, and
  API routes compile on their *first request* — which would otherwise be the
  prompt. `actions/page-ready.ts` waits for the document to finish, the DOM to
  stop changing, the input to be genuinely enabled, and `runtimeWarmPath` to be
  built, before any handler types anything. Without it a cold route produces a
  video of a prompt that was never really sent.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`Aborting before launching a browser`** — a service is down. The message names
which one and the command to start it. `--force` overrides.

**A page fails with "Agent never produced a response within 30s"** — either the
demo is genuinely broken, or `selectors.config.ts → assistantMessage` does not
match this app's messages. Run `npm run doctor --online` to tell the two apart.

**The IDE highlights the wrong lines** — the line range drifted. `npm run doctor`
names the file and where its markers actually are now.

**A page fails once, then passes unchanged** — the Mastra agent's first model call
after an idle period can exceed the 30s response window. This is the most common
false failure here; re-run the page before investigating anything else.

**A page fails only on the first run after starting the dev server** — it was
still compiling. The readiness gate absorbs this (it will log
`agent endpoint compiled in Ns` when it did real work), but the *agent's* own
cold start is separate: the first model call after starting the backend can take
~60s, which is longer than the 30s response window. Send one message by hand, or
record a single page, before running the full suite.

**A recording passes but the video is wrong** — the doctor cannot see cursor
placement or highlight correctness. Watch it.
